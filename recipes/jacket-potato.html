        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 large Russet potatoes (see note 1)</li>
          <li>1-2 tablespoons olive oil, optional</li>
          <li>Sea salt to taste, optional</li>
          <li>1 cup vegan sour cream (see note 2)</li>
          <li>1 cup vegan shredded cheese (see note 3)</li>
          <li>1 cup vegan bacon bits (see note 4)</li>
          <li>½ cup green onions or chives, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Prep: Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218
            degrees Celsius) and lining a baking tray with a silicone baking mat
            or parchment paper. You don’t have to line it, but if you’re going
            to oil and salt your potatoes, it saves on pan cleanup. I find the
            baking mat easier to clean than the tray.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pierce potatoes: Pierce cleaned potatoes with a fork a few times--I
            don’t know for sure that the potato won’t blow up, but I do think it
            helps it cook more evenly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional step: Rub potatoes with a bit of olive oil and sprinkle on
            a bit of sea salt. Rub the salt around so it doesn’t concentrate in
            one spot. You don’t need to go crazy with it--we’ll be adding more
            flavor later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake: Bake potatoes for 40-70 minutes--this entirely depends on just
            how big your potatoes are. The way to tell if they’re done is to
            pierce them with a fork--if the fork easily goes through, they’re
            done. Mine took about 42 minutes. That’s kinda precise, but it was a
            guess and I was right, lol.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rest: Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them rest a few
            minutes--they’re pretty hot right now anyway, obviously.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn up oven heat: Turn up the oven heat to 475 degrees Fahrenheit
            (246 degrees Celsius) or so. I find this heat is good for melting
            the vegan cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut open the potatoes: If you want, use a fork to gently mash up
            some of the inside. I just drag the fork back and forth a few times
            on each inner side of the potato to kind of fluff up the innards a
            bit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stuff the potatoes: You can add a little vegan butter right now if
            you want, but I didn’t find it necessary with all the other stuff I
            added. Add the vegan sour cream and a generous layer of vegan
            cheese. Since I precooked my homemade vegan bacon bits, it worked
            better to add them after the second baking. I also wait till the end
            to add the green onions or chives since they’ll burn at this
            temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake again: Place the potatoes back in the oven and cook just until
            the cheese is melted. I find 5-10 minutes is sufficient. You can use
            the broiler if you prefer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add more toppings: Remove from the oven, let cool for a few minutes,
            sprinkle with vegan bacon bits and green onions or chives and enjoy!
          </li>
          <li>
            Store: Refrigerate leftover baked potatoes in an airtight container
            for 3-4 days. I recommend reheating in the oven but the microwave
            will also work. I just think the texture is best when reheated in
            the oven, but I don’t always have that option if taking leftovers to
            work.
