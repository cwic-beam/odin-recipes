      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 block (12 to 15 ounces) organic extra-firm tofu</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tamari* or soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch or arrowroot starch</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large, rimmed
          baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the tofu from sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
          To prepare the tofu: Drain the tofu and use your palms to gently
          squeeze out some of the water. Slice the tofu into thirds lengthwise
          so you have 3 even slabs. Stack the slabs on top of each other and
          slice through them lengthwise to make 3 even columns, then slice
          across to make 5 even rows (see photos).
        </li>
        <li>
          Line a cutting board with a lint-free tea towel or paper towels, then
          arrange the tofu in an even layer on the towel(s). Fold the towel(s)
          over the cubed tofu, then place something heavy on top (like another
          cutting board, topped with a cast iron pan or large cans of tomatoes)
          to help the tofu drain. Let the tofu rest for at least 10 minutes
          (preferably more like 30 minutes, if you have the time).
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the pressed tofu to a medium mixing bowl and drizzle with the
          olive oil and tamari. Toss to combine. Sprinkle the starch over the
          tofu, and toss the tofu until the starch is evenly coated, so there
          are no powdery spots remaining.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tip the bowl of tofu over onto your prepared baking sheet and arrange
          the tofu in an even layer. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing the tofu
          halfway, until the tofu is deeply golden on the edges. Use as desired.
        </li>
