        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            283 g gluten-free pasta (such as fusilli // or sub whole wheat)*
          </li>
          <li>85 g sun-dried tomatoes (1 cup yield ~3 ounces)</li>
          <li>60 ml extra virgin olive oil*</li>
          <li>24 g fresh basil (plus more for serving)</li>
          <li>2-4 cloves garlic</li>
          <li>10 g Vegan Parmesan Cheese (plus more for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Boil water, add salt, and then add pasta. Cook according to package
            instructions. Pasta with grooves is best.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil, basil, garlic (starting with
            lesser amount), and vegan parmesan cheese to a food processor or
            high-speed blender and puree into a pesto-like consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it has trouble mixing, add a bit of hot pasta water (2-3 Tbsp //
            amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch
            size) to help encourage it along. It doesnâ€™t need to be finely
            pureed, just well mixed. I think a bit of texture is a good thing in
            this dish. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more garlic for
            zing, basil for herbiness, or vegan parmesan cheese for cheesiness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add drained pasta back to the pot you cooked it in and add pesto.
            Toss to coat and season with a bit more olive oil and vegan
            parmesan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve warm with additional fresh basil and vegan parmesan cheese.
            Store covered in the fridge for up to a few days, though best when
            fresh.
          </li>
          <li>
            This can be enjoyed hot, slightly chilled or at room temperature,
            making it ideal for picnics and take-along lunches!
